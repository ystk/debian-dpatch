[Testsuite documentation]

This directory contains the testsuite for dpatch.
Run the run-test.sh program with this directory as current directory.

This testsuite requires the following packages installed:
     dpatch (it will not run the test against the source)
     debhelper

The order of scripts is important; to add new tests, 
add it after the existing tests.
The tests are of [0-9][0-9]_*.sh style.

The exit code of the scripts are used to convey success/fail of tests.
    0: success
    non-0: failure


The log of execution is stored as test.log.summary,
and log of individual runs are stored in log/$SCRIPTNAME
compare the output between releases to find regression.
