dpatch-edit-patch:

Now launching an interactive shell in your work directory. Edit your files.
When you are done, exit the shell. When you exit the shell, your patch will be
automatically updated based on the changes in your work directory.

If you wish to abort the process, exit the shell such that it returns an exit
code of "230". This is typically done by exiting the shell with the command
'exit 230'.
