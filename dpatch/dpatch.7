.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A \fBdpatch\fR is a program that modifies the source tree in a given
\fIdirectory\fR. How it does that is entirely up to the person
writing it. It can be a script that calls \fBpatch\fR(1) with the
appropriate options, a complicated perl script that does some deep
magic, or anything else. The only requirement is that it \fBMUST\fR
accept the \fI\-patch\fR and \fI\-unpatch\fR options, followed by the
destination (or working) directory, when specified. For the sake of
compatibility, the second argument is only present when a working
directory was explicitly set with \fBdpatch \-\-workdir\fR.

For some of the \fBdpatch\fR(1) features to work, the script should
follow a common style: there should be a line near the top of the file
with the following format: "\fIfilename\fR \-\- \fIauthor\fR
<\fIemail\fR>". And one or more "# DP: \fIdescription\fR" lines. These
will be used by \fBdpatch cat\fR for example.

.SH WARNING
.B dpatch
is deprecated, please switch to the `3.0 (quilt)' Debian source
package format instead. See
.I http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0#FAQ
for a short guide on how to do it.
