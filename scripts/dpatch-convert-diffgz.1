.SH SYNOPSIS

.br
.BI dpatch\-convert\-diffgz " patchno_patchname"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the

command which simply generates a dpatch file from an existing Debian .diff.gz
file.

It does so, by building the sources with dpkg-buildpackage, and operating on the
resulting Debian .diff.gz.

.SH WARNING
.B dpatch
is deprecated, please switch to the `3.0 (quilt)' Debian source
package format instead. See
.I http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0#FAQ
for a short guide on how to do it.
