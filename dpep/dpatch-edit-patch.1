.TH DPATCH-EDIT-PATCH 1 "23 Oct 2011" DPATCH "dpatch users manual"
.SH NAME
dpatch\-edit\-patch \- maintain dpatch patches for a Debian source package
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch [\fIoptions\fP] command \fIdpatchname\fP [\fIbasepatch\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual documents the
.B "dpatch\-edit\-patch"
command which maintains dpatch patches for a dpatch-using Debian
source package.

.B "dpatch\-edit\-patch"
will copy the full tree to a temporary directory for working.

.SH WARNING
.B dpatch
is deprecated, please switch to the `3.0 (quilt)' Debian source
package format instead. See
.I http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0#FAQ
for a short guide on how to do it.

.SH OPTIONS
.B "dpatch\-edit\-patch"
takes two forms of arguments; options and commands.
Currently, the only command that exists is \(lqpatch\(rq, which allows you to
create/edit dpatches.
When no command is given, \(lqpatch\(rq is assumed.

.SS COMMANDS:
.TP
.I patch
This command requires one mandatory argument, and accepts one optional
argument under certain circumstances.
The mandatory argument is
.IR "dpatchname" .
This refers to a dpatch, as it would be listed in
.IR "debian/patches/00list" .
It is not necessary for
.I "dpatchname"
to exist prior to running
.B "dpatch\-edit\-patch" "patch"
.IR "dpatchname" .

When 
.I dpatchname
exists,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will set up a working source tree, apply all dpatches listed in
.I debian/patches/00list
up to and including
.IR dpatchname ,
and spawn an interactive shell for the developer. The developer then
edits files in this working tree. When the developer is done, they
exit the shell.
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
then updates \fIdpatchname\fP to reflect the changes made.
Should the developer wish to abort the process from the interactive shell, they
need only cause the shell to exit with an exit value of 230.
Typically, this is done by exiting the shell with the command
.BR "exit 230" .

Would the developer wish to see the patch one's currently works on
without exiting the subshell, two environment variables are exported
into the subshell to help with this: \fBDPEP_SHELL_REFDIR\fR, which is
set to the reference directory's full name, and
\fBDPEP_SHELL_WORKDIR\fR, which is set to the subshell's working
directory.

These two can be used to \- for example \- generate a diff between the
reference version and the current tree:

.RS
.RS
.I diff -urNa \fB$DPEP_SHELL_REFDIR\fR \fB$DPEP_SHELL_WORKDIR\fR
.RE
.RE

When \fIdpatchname\fR does not exist,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will assume that a new dpatch should be created. As with the above
scenario,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
first creates a working source tree. If the optional argument
.I basepatch
is supplied, all dpatches in
.I debian/patches/00list
up to and including
.I basepatch
will be applied to the working tree.
If
.I basepatch
is not supplied, no dpatches are applied to the working tree.  When
then developer exits the shell,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will create
.I dpatchname\fP.
If
.I debian/patches/00template
does not exist, a hardcoded dpatch header and shell snippet will be
used. If it exists and is not executable, it will be copied verbatim
as the header and shell snippet.

Its first parameter is the base filename of the
.IR to\-be\-updated " or " to\-be\-created
dpatch (useful for adding titles to the dpatch header). Its second
parameter will be the description of the new patch.
.SS OPTIONS
For the following options, command\-line arguments take precedence over
environment variables, which take precedence over configuration
variables. Configuration variables are read from
\fIdebian/patches/00dpatch.conf\fR and \fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR.
.TP 
.IB "\-s, \-\-sourcedir=" value
Directory containing unpacked Debian source package.
Configuration variable \fBconf_sourcedir\fR (settable only in
\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable \fBDPEP_SOURCEDIR\fR.
Defaults to the current working directory.
.TP
.IB "\-o, \-\-outdir="value
Directory where the updated or newly-created dpatch will be placed.
Configuration variable \fBconf_outdir\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment
variable \fBDPEP_OUTDIR\fR. Defaults to
.I ./debian/patches/
.TP
.IB "\-c, \-\-clean"
Indicate to
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
that the current work directory can safely be cleaned. If not given,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
tries to preserve partial or complete builds by first copying the
current work directory to a reference directory before invoking
\fIdebian/rules\fR clean on the reference directory. If given, the
current directory is cleaned and then taken as a reference
directory. Use this option if your source package is pretty large and
no significant work is destroyed by cleaning. Configuration variable
\fBconf_clean\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), Environment variable \fBDPEP_CLEAN\fR.
.TP
.IB "\-b, \-\-debianonly[="path]
Indicate to 
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
that the current work directory only contains a debian subdirectory
and that an upstream tarball is to be unpacked in the reference
directory before copying the current work directory there. The
optional argument is the path to the upstream tarball - including the
tarball name. If no value is given,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will use the hook script pointed to by \fBconf_getorigtargz\fR
(\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR) or \fBDPEP_GETORIGTARGZ\fR to obtain the
upstream tarball. The hook script should take one argument: the
destination directory where the fetched archive shall be put.
Configuration variables: \fBconf_debianonly\fR (\fIdebian/patches/00dpatch.conf\fR)
and \fBconf_origtargz\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), Environment Variables
\fBDPEP_DEBIANONLY\fR and \fBDPEP_ORIGTARGZ\fR.
.TP
.IB "\-P, \-\-origtargzpath="path
When
.IB \-b
is in use, specify the path where upstream tarballs should be looked for.
.B path
is a colon-separated list of directories.
Configuration variables: \fBconf_origtargzpath\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR),
Environment Variables \fBDPEP_ORIGTARGZPATH\fR.
.TP
.IB "\-r, \-\-rootcmd="value
Command used to gain root privileges used to clean DPEP_SOURCEDIR.
Configuration variable \fBconf_rootcmd\fR, environment variable \fBDPEP_ROOTCMD\fR.
Defaults to \fBfakeroot\fR, if installed.
If none of the above are specified, and fakeroot is not installed,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will abort.
The dpatch authors strongly recommend the use of fakeroot for this purpose.
.TP
.IB "\-d, \-\-description="value
Description used for a newly-created patch.
Configuration variable \fBconf_newdesc\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable
\fBDPEP_NEWDESC\fR, defaults to
.I \(lqNo description.\(rq
.TP
.IB "\-k, \-\-keeptemp="value
Boolean value, either \fI0\fR or \fI1\fR.
Configuration variable \fBconf_keeptemp\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable
\fBDPEP_KEEPTEMP\fR. When set to \fI1\fR, temporary working tree is not
deleted when
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
is done.
.TP
.IB "\-t, \-\-tmpdir="value
Temporary directory within which
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will create the working source tree.
Configuration variable \fBconf_tmpdir\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable
\fBDPEP_TMPDIR\fR. Should none of the above be set,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will first attempt to use the environment variable \fBTMPDIR\fR, and
will fall back to
.IR /tmp .
.TP
.IB "\-p, \-\-stampdir="value
The directory 
.B dpatch
has used for creating patch stamps.
Used for checking if patch to be edited is already applied 
to the working tree.
Configuration variable \fBconf_stampdir\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable
\fBDPEP_STAMPDIR\fR. Should none of the above be set,
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will fall back to
.B debian/patched
.TP
.IB "\-e, \-\-exclude="valuelist
Space-separated list of file- and directory names that
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
will exclude from being copied and diffed.
Configuration variable \fBconf_exclude\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable
\fBDPEP_EXCLUDE\fR. Defaults to "CVS .svn .git .arch .hg _darcs .bzr", which might cause you
trouble if you use files named like that in your package.
.TP
.IB "\-O, \-\-diffopts="valuelist
Extra options to directly pass to
.B diff
as-is.
Configuration variable \fBconf_diffopts\fR (\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR),
environment variable \fBDPEP_DIFF_OPTIONS\fR. It is empty by default.
.TP
.IB "\-l, \-\-shell="shell
Tell
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
which shell to invoke. Configuration variable \fBconf_shell\fR
(\fI~/.dpatch.conf\fR), environment variable \fBDPEP_SHELL\fR, defaulting to
$SHELL and the user's default shell.
.TP
.IB "\-n, \-\-notimestamp"
Tell
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
to remove timestamps from the diffs it generates. Can also be set in
\fIdebian/patches/00options\fR, with the \fBDPEP_OMIT_TIMESTAMPS\fR
variable.
.TP
.IB "\-0, \-\-add2list"
add the new patch to 00list file.
.TP
.IB "\-a, \-\-applyall"
apply all available patches.

.SH NOTES
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
uses the \fBDEBFULLNAME\fR environment variable as the author's
name. If it is unset, the author name will be left blank.
.PP
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
determines the author's email address for new patches using
the following algorithm:
.br
1) Should the \fBDEBEMAIL\fR environment variable exist, it is always used.
.br
2) If the \fBEMAIL\fR environment variable exists, it will be used when
\fBDEBEMAIL\fR does not exist.
.br
3) Should neither of the first two attempts succeed, the email will be
constructed using the login name of the user running
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
combined with the output of \fBhostname \-f\fR.
.PP
When
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
sets up a reference or a working directory, it dereferences all
symlinks in the source. That allows relative links to continue
working, and allows changes only to a single file and not to the
linked file and the link target. If you use
.B dpatch\-edit\-patch
on source trees that have symbolic links, you might end up with a
patch that is unapplyable to the original tree.
