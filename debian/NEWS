dpatch (2.0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  As of now, dpatch is deprecated, superseded by the 3.0 (quilt) source
  format, and should not be used for new packages. Existing packages are
  strongly encouraged to migrate to the new source format, too.

dpatch (2.0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  [dpatch.lib.sh / dpatch-run]

  The behaviour of dpatch.lib.sh (used by dpatch-run, and the default
  templates) was changed: it now resets the timestamp of all patched
  files to the same timestamp within a single dpatch, if and only if
  patchutils is installed.

  [debhelper]

  dpatch now also includes debhelper 7+ sequence support, and adding
  dpatch support to a dh-using rules file is as easy as this:

    %:
    	dh $@ --with dpatch

  [dpatch-get-origtargz]

  dpatch-get-origtargz was removed, as it does not work with anything
  else but tar.gz archives, and was becoming a source of ugly bugs and
  workarounds.

  Consequently, the dpatch-edit-patch will not try to use it, either.

dpatch (2.0.11) experimental; urgency=low

  With this version, the default behaviour of dpatch-edit-patch was
  changed to not clean the source tree before copying it. Also, a new
  option which is intended to ease working with trees under revision
  control that only have a debian/ directory, was added too. See the
  manual page for more information about these (the --clean and
  --debianonly options).

  Please test the new features, so we can iron out any bugs before the
  package hits unstable!

dpatch (2.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpatch comes with two helper scripts, which make
  the creation of dpatch scriptlets easier. For the most simple
  cases, there is /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch-run, that should be used
  on the she-bang line, like this:

    #! /bin/sh /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch-run
    ## foo.dpatch -- by J. Random Hacker
    ## DP: Patch description

    [And here comes the patch in the usual diff format]

  This dpatch-run script will do all the shell magic to make the
  dpatch work.

  For advanced uses, where something other than patch is used for
  applying dpatches, there is /usr/share/dpatch/dpatch.lib.sh. This
  one is intended to be sourced by shell scripts. By default, it will
  still use patch, however, setting DPATCH_LIB_NO_DEFAULT to a
  non-empty value makes it call dpatch_patch and dpatch_unpatch,
  respectively. The main use of this shell library is to leave the
  command-line parsing and verification to the script.

dpatch (2.0.0) experimental; urgency=low

  This is a complete rewrite of dpatch as a shell script with a well
  defined interface, which provides enormous flexibility. This makes it
  possible to do a set of interesting things with dpatch scriptlets, like
  adding custom arguments (pkg-info, for printing detailed patch
  information, and the like), filter the patch list through cpp, and many
  other interesting things.

  However, due to the amount of new code, we feel that this rewrite needs
  wider testing, hence this upload to experimental.

  Please help, and test this release, and report any problems you may
  encounter!

dpatch (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  Versions of dpatch up to and including version 1.22 had two
  developer-accessible methods of telling dpatch what patches to apply;
  debian/patches/00list, and the variable "$PATCHLIST". The variable
  $PATCHLIST was always sorted before patches were applied an unapplied, but
  the list from debian/patches/00list was only sorted when there was also an
  arch-specific list such as debian/patches/00list.${ARCH}.

  As of this version (1.23), dpatch no longer sorts the patch list, period.
  The maintainers feel that dpatch's user base is likely full of
  anal-retentive folk (very much like themselves :) who prefer specifying
  things in minute detail.

  If your package uses the $PATCHLIST variable to tell dpatch which patches to
  apply, or if you use debian/patches/00list as well as an arch-specific patch
  list, you may want to double-check that the patches apply in correct order
  when they aren't sorted.
