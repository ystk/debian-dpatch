dpatch (2.0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mark the package Multi-Arch: foreign, thanks Riku Voipio

dpatch (2.0.34) unstable; urgency=high

  * The magic that was supposed to reset the timestamps of patched files
    failed to take the --workdir option into account. This has now been
    corrected. (Closes: #651948)

    Urgency high because this bug breaks any build that uses --workdir,
    and has patchutils installed.

dpatch (2.0.33) unstable; urgency=low

dpatch (2.0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Maintainer (Closes: #562697).
  * Add build-arch and build-indep targets, as suggested by Lintian.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2.
  * Convert to format "3.0 (native)".
  * Update the Vcs-* fields.
  * Convert debian/changelog to DEP-5 format.
  * Include documentation to work with debian/-only VCS layouts. Thanks,
    Daniel Leidert! (Closes: #449190)
  * Bugs fixed:
    + dpatch-edit-patch now allows colons in directory names. Patch from
      Sandro Tosi <matrixhasu@gmail.com> (Closes: #405493).
    + dpatch-edit-patch accepts the (documented) -r option
      (Closes: #388658).
    + Depend on dpkg-dev, for dpkg-architecture (Closes: #473680).
    + Print errors to stderr (Closes: #559168).
    + dpatch.make correctly sets the patch and unpatch targets as .PHONY
      (Closes: #456919).
    + CPP mode sets DEB_BUILD_ARCH_$arch correctly on non-linux archs
      (Closes: #355278).
    + Corrected dpatch(1) to make the patch/unpatch aliases clear
      (Closes: #372787).
    + Fixed documentation of how dpatch-edit-patch determines the author's
      name (Closes: #407306).
    + dpatch-edit-patch now properly respects $DPEP_TMPDIR
      (Closes: #403903).
    + dpatch-edit-patch now properly detects upstream versions with a
      hyphen (Closes: #445179).
  * New features:
    + dpatch-edit-patch can pass extra options to diff (via the
      DPEP_DIFF_OPTIONS environment variable, or -O command-line option)
      (Closes: #330594).
    + debhelper 7 (dh) support added, patch from Hideki Yamane (Debian-JP)
      <henrich@debian.or.jp> (Closes: #573567)
    + dpatches using dpatch.lib.sh's default patching mechanism will now
      also reset the timestamps of all patched files to be the same accross
      all files, if patchutils is installed (Closes: #466364).
    + dpatch-convert-diffgz now accepts PATCHNO_PATCHNAME format arguments
      too, similar to dpatch-edit-patch (Closes: #328730).
    + dpatch.make's patch target can now (optionally) depend on other make
      targets (Closes: #400888).
    + dpatch-edit-patch now export two variables to the subshell:
      DPEP_SHELL_REFDIR and DPEP_SHELL_WORKDIR (see the manual for details)
      (Closes: #481237).
    + dpatch-edit-patch can now (optionally) remove timestamps from the
      diffs it generates. See the manual page for details
      (Closes: #342774).
  * Features removed:
    + dpatch-get-origtargz is gone. With debian/rules get-orig-source and
      uupdate, it is of no use anymore. It was a source of bugs, however,
      and did not work with anything else but tar.gz archives.
      (Closes: #391776)
    + dpatch-cowdancer-patch was removed aswell, because due to the
      dpatch-get-origtargz removal, it would've needed an update. But I
      never used it, don't understand it, and would rather remove a tool
      than ship a broken one.
    + dpatch-edit-patch does not automatically attempt to fetch the
      original tarball when called with the -b option. It will still try
      to execute any hooks set, however.

dpatch (2.0.6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Gergely Nagy:
    - dpep/dpatch-edit-patch: When editing a pre-existing patch, force
      dpatch to skip creating stamp files (as they'd show up in the diff,
      which is a Bad Thing).
    - dpatch/dpatch_patchset.shpp: Fixed a serious file name comparsion
      bug (noticed by David B Harris).
  * David B Harris:
    - dpep/dpatch-edit-patch: Use 'debian/rules clean unpatch' to clean the
      source tree before replication - this allows for one to ship a
      regular-style source package (with all the patches applied to the tree)
      even if dpatch is used. Thanks, Bill Allombert. (Closes: #195823)
    - Use 'grep -F' instead of 'egrep -F'. The latter is seriously broken.

dpatch (2.0.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * David B Harris:
    - Mention in the manpage that if a maintainer wants to preprocess their
      00list with cpp, they need to add it to Build-Depends or
      Build-Depends-Indep, as it isn't a dpatch dependency.
    - dpatch/dpatch_lowlevel.shpp: Make sure stampfile is put in place even if
      patching fails - without this, a half-applied dpatch wouldn't be
      un-half-applied via 'debian/rules unpatch'. Future attempts to
      'debian/rules patch', even with a fixed dpatch, would fail.
    - dpatch/dpatch_template.shpp: Add @DPATCH@ tag to generated template
    - dpep/dpatch-edit-patch: Fix bug where if the interactive subshell exited
      with *anything* other than 0, the script would abort (and not clean up,
      at that). The intention is to only abort if the shell exits with code
      230 (ie: the developer explicitly goes 'exit 230').
    - dpep/dpatch-edit-patch{,.functions}: Port to using new /usr/bin/dpatch
      calls instead of reimplementing the (old) dpatch.make. Also support an
      executable 00template (which is supposed to dump the dpatch header to
      STDOUT) via DPEP_OPTION_EXEC_TEMPLATE=1 in 00options. Not yet
      documented.

      sorry).

 -- David B Harris <david@eelf.ddts.net>  Sun,  3 Aug 2003 06:42:42 -0400

dpatch (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    - dpatch.make (PATCHLIST): Only expand this once.
    (UNPATCHLIST): Likewise.
    (DEB_BUILD_ARCH): New variable.
    (DPATCH_ARCH): Use ${DEB_BUILD_ARCH}, to be far more friendly to
    existing practice.
    - README: Added a note about dpatch.make's usage of ${PACKAGE}, and a
    warning about some dpatch-* tools not respecting ${PATCHLIST}.
  * Gergely Nagy:
    - dpatch.make (PATCHLIST): Removed the sorting stuff.
    - dpatch-list-patch: Likewise.
  * The removal of the sorting stuff, and Henrique's changes:
    (Closes: #203353).

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@bonehunter.rulez.org>  Thu, 31 Jul 2003 12:33:04 +0200

dpatch (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag release:
    - 'dpatch.make:45: *** unterminated call to function `shell': missing `)'
      fixed, caused all builds with 1.21 to break. Let us never upload on
      Friday the 13th again.

 -- David B Harris <david@eelf.ddts.net>  Sat, 14 Jun 2003 04:01:28 -0400

dpatch (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gergely Nagy:
    - dpatch.make (PATCHLIST_ALL): Do not hide stderr.
      (PATCHLIST_ARCH): Likewise.
      Patch from Joshua Kwan and Era Eriksson. (Closes: #195626)
  * David B Harris:
    - dpatch-edit-patch.functions (dpep_template_hardcoded):
      Don't append .dpatch to patch filename, dpep-edit-patch does that for
      us. Thanks James Troup, Closes: #196329
    - dpatch-edit-patch: Fix bad sed call (Closes: #196893)

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@bonehunter.rulez.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2003 22:52:52 +0200

dpatch (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * David B. Harris:
    - dpatch-edit-patch, dpatch-edit-patch.functions, dpatch-edit-patch.1:
      + The meaning of CLI option -k (keep temporary working directory) was
        reversed. Thanks to Era Eriksson for the patch :) (Closes: #193392)
      + Another patch from Era - thanks again! This one allows
        debian/patches/00template to be executable. See the manpage for more
        details. (Closes: #193481)
  * Gergely Nagy:
    - debian/control (Standards-Version): Bumped to 3.5.10.0.
    - dpatch.make (PATCHLIST_ALL): Redirect stderr to /dev/null.
      (PATCHLIST_ARCH): Likewise.
      Noticed by James Troup. (Closes: #195104)
    - debian/rules (binary-indep): Mark all files in ${DPATCH}/etc as
      conffiles.
    - dpatch-list-patch: Use "$( (" instead of "$((". The latter is
      treated as an aritmetic expression by dash, thus parsing fails. With
      a space between the two parens, it is correctly recognised as a
      nested command substitution thingy.
    - dpatch-convert-diffgz: Addedd support for epochs. Patch from Junichi
      Uekawa. (Closes: #195443)

 -- David B Harris <david@eelf.ddts.net>  Mon, 26 May 2003 03:00:28 -0400

dpatch (1.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gergely Nagy:
    - dpatch-edit-patch.1: Corrected a typo. Noticed by Stephen Quinney
      (Closes: #190557)
    - dpatch-list-patch (dplp_print_info): New function. This handles
      adding the .dpatch suffix when necessary. Use this to print
      information about a dpatch.

      Also, if there is no debian/patches/00list, use some clever GNU make
      trickery to extract ${PATCHLIST} out of debian/rules (probably needs
      polishing though)
    - dpatch-convert-diffgz: Remove the .dpatch suffix from
      DPCD_PATCHNAME, if any.
    - dpatch.make (patch): Check if $$patch exists, and only append a
      .dpatch prefix if it doesn't.
      (unpatch): Likewise.
      (PATCHLIST_ALL): Allow `#' comments in the patch list (ie, filter
      them out)
      (PATCHLIST_ARCH): Likewise. Patch from Bastian Kleineidam.
      (Closes: #192509)
    - The last two entries, as well as the next two, Closes: #191277
    - README: Updated according to recent changes.
  * David B Harris:
    - dpatch-edit-patch: Loosen the format of debian/patches/00list. Now
      somebody can supply the .dpatch extension therein, should they choose to
      do so.
    - dpatch-list-patch: Add comment-line support for dpatch-list-patch.
      (closes the other half of #192509)
    - Include a bash context-sensitive completion definition file,
      /etc/bash_completion.d/dpatch_edit_patch, kindly written by Bastian
      Kleineidam and cleaned up by myself. (Closes: #191453)

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@bonehunter.rulez.org>  Wed, 23 Apr 2003 17:24:57 +0200

dpatch (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * David B. Harris:
   - dpatch-edit-patch(1) rewrite. Please read `man dpatch-edit-patch', and/or
     /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README, it has changed a great deal. Basically, now
     you just 'dpatch-edit-patch dpathname', where dpatchname is exactly as it
     would be listed in 00list. dpep will spawn a subshell. Edit your files.
     Exit the subshell. The dpatch will be created or updated, as is required.
     (Closes: #187959)
   - Rewrite manpage for dpatch-edit-patch. Thanks to Andreas Metzler for the
     current groff formatting. (Closes: #188486)
   - Clarify examples and README with respect to phony targets and what that
     means.
  * Joerg Jaspert:
   - Added David B. Harris to Uploaders Field.

 -- Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2003 16:36:43 +0200

dpatch (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gergely Nagy:
    - The `Figure out something to put here, and delete this' release.
    - dpatch.make (patch): (patch-stamp): Create a subdirectory under
      debian/patched, if necessary. Patch from David B Harris.
      (unpatch): Remove patch-stampT too. Suggestion from Joshua Kwan.
      (Closes: #186522)
  * Joerg Jaspert:
    - Added a paragraph about usage of .PHONY or stamp-files to the
      README and changed one example rules file so we show both ways
      of playing with it. This (closes: #187293)

 -- Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Apr 2003 01:19:23 +0200

dpatch (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * The `Feh, you missed me!' release.
  * dpatch-edit-patch.1: Fixed a typo I introduced when importing Andreas'
    work. Noticed by him.
  * debian/control (Standards-Version): Bumped to 3.5.9.0.
    (Description): Rearranged a bit, to look more structured.
  * dpatch-edit-patch: Bail out if ${DPEP_TMPDIR} does not exist. This way
    we can safely use mkdir to create ${DPEP_OUTDIR}, and then check its
    exit status. Fix suggested by David B Harris. (Closes: #182640)

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@bonehunter.rulez.org>  Sun, 16 Mar 2003 23:58:24 +0100

dpatch (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * The `dpatch-edit-patch is not broken, but shoot me anyway' release.

    problem tracking. (Closes: #182641)
  * dpatch-edit-patch: Changed default description to something less lame
    and productive.
  * dpatch-edit-patch: Fixed a typo.
  * dpatch-edit-patch: Added ${DPEP_PKGNAME} to some more places, so it
    will actually work.

    information is determined.
  * The above ones fix the multi-problem bugreport from James Troup,
    except the EXAMPLES section in dpatch-edit-patch.1.

    Kowalik)
  * dpatch.make: Use make syntax, not shell, when determining DPATCH_ARCH.
    Thanks to Martin Loschwitz. (Closes: #183828)

dpatch (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpatch-list-patch now really does what i announced in 1.10. Silly me.
    (closes: #182590)
  * Mention the needed Build-Depends in Readme. (closes: #182598)

 -- Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Feb 2003 22:00:14 +0100

dpatch (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

dpatch (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now dpatch-edit-patch adds the source-package name to tmpdirs it
    creates. That way they dont conflict if you edit similar patchnumbers
    in different packages. (closes: #182134)

 -- Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Feb 2003 00:09:58 +0100

dpatch (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified README to reflect latest changes to dpatch and its tools.
    If you are a better documentation writer: Please take a look at
    this file and make it readable. Thx. :)
  * Modified dpatch-list-patches to list patches that apply everywhere
    (eg. that are in 00list) and patches that apply only on specific
    Architectures (eg. listed in 00list.*) with different headers.
  * Modified Description to tell users that its easy to have
    architecture specific patches now. :)

 -- Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Feb 2003 23:35:01 +0100

dpatch (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modularized the patch list. It is now constructed from
    debian/patches/00list and 00list.${ARCH} (where ${ARCH} is the
    architecture we're building for). Also, one can override the PATCHLIST
    variable, and that will Just Work. So you can use dpatch without
    00list too! :)
  * Applied meta-data preserving patch to dpatch-edit-patch, thanks to
    Eduard Bloch. (Closes: #182140)
  * Added dpatch-convert-diffgz from Junichi Uekawa (with minor
    modifications). (Closes: #176831)
  * debian/control (Recommends): Recommend dpkg-dev, fakeroot and
    patchutils, since we are using them in some of the scripts.

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@bonehunter.rulez.org>  Mon, 24 Feb 2003 18:17:10 +0100

dpatch (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

dpatch (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

        patch fail
